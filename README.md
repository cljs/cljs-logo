# ClojureScript Logo By The Community

This logo was created for use by the ClojureScript community and cljs.info
website, partly inspired by the following excerpt from the [2011 Launch Plan]
on ClojureScript's wiki:

> I think ClojureScript should have a separate visual identity from Clojure
> proper, though it should pay homeage to the Clojure identity.

We use the same colors and similar dual hemispheres as the [Clojure logo] to
represent the joining of the Clojure and JavaScript worlds. Parentheses form a
simple notched circle around it.

The community logo was first printed on stickers and spread at Clojure/West
2015.  [This](https://twitter.com/swannodette/status/589949769457410048) was
tweeted, and [Josh] shared a neat interpretation:

> I just noticed one more feature of the cljs logo. If you consider the
> parentheses as a function invocation, and read the differently colored
> letters as two different symbols, it reads (cl js), something like "apply
> Clojure to JavaScript." Very cool.

## Formats

The logo has three variations:
