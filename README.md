# ClojureScript Logo

A logo for the the [ClojureScript language].

## Design

ClojureScript is a simple, powerful language and we wanted the logo to reflect
this power and simplicity. We also wanted to pay homage to the Clojure logo,
while creating a new visual identity.

The logo pays homage to the [Clojure logo] in shape and color. The logo uses two
of the four colors from the Clojure logo. Using two colors makes it easier to
integrate the logo with different color palettes and allows for cleaner contrast
against different backgrounds. The colors also match the "green on the left" /
"blue on the right" split of the original Clojure logo. Finally, the logo is
circular in shape with a "break" through the body.

The logo has both a divided and cohesive appearance. Two halfs are created using
color and the breaks between the arcs. This split symbolizes the relationship
between "Clojure the language" and "JavaScript the platform" that is essentially
ClojureScript. For cohesion, the kerning of the "cljs" letters is careful
**not** to reflect this split (see the tail of the "j") so that "cljs" appears
as one word. Additionally, the two arcs would form a circle if they continued,
so visually your mind "fills the gap" and makes the arcs appear as a single,
encompassing circle.

The arcs serve a dual-purpose. People who are familiar with Lisp and understand
the unique importance parentheses play in the language will see the arcs as
parentheses and notice that the logo is like a function call "applying Clojure
to JavaScript". Users unfamiliar with Lisp will see the arcs structurally as a
circle that bounds the logo and centers the text. Hopefully those users will
learn more about the language and have an "Aha!" moment in the future when they
discover the dual-purpose :)

The logo consists of geometric shapes with smooth curves: creating a beautiful,
clean, and simple aesthetic. This has the added benefit of being easily rendered
by a computer and stored in simple SVG markup that can be rendered on many
devices. The file size of the transparent SVG logo is a mere 2,313 bytes, small
enough to be embedded in the [source code of a program] directly.

## Variants

The logo has three variations:

| ![white]                             | ![clear]                               | ![outline]                               |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| [cljs-white.svg]<br>[cljs-white.png] | [cljs.svg]<br>[cljs.png]               | [cljs-outline.svg]<br>[cljs-outline.png] |

The white background is good for [stickers] and for contrast against non-dark
backgrounds.

Clear works well against dark backgrounds where the white contrast would be too
jarring. Examples: [Solar System of JS] and [cljsfiddle.com].

The outline variation omits the text and thickens the arcs slightly. It is
mainly used at small scales where the "cljs" letters would become illegible.
