# ClojureScript Logo By The Community

This logo was created for use by the ClojureScript community, partly inspired
by the following excerpt from the [2011 Launch Plan] on ClojureScript's wiki:

> I think ClojureScript should have a separate visual identity from Clojure
> proper, though it should pay homeage to the Clojure identity.

We use the same colors and similar dual hemispheres as the [Clojure logo] to
represent the joining of the Clojure and JavaScript worlds. Parentheses form a
simple notched circle around it.

The community logo was first printed on
[stickers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cljsinfo/logo.cljs/master/cljs-empty.png)
and spread at Clojure/West 2015. [Josh] shared a neat interpretation:

> I just noticed one more feature of the cljs logo. If you consider the
> parentheses as a function invocation, and read the differently colored
> letters as two different symbols, it reads (cl js), something like "apply
> Clojure to JavaScript." Very cool.

## Formats

The logo has three variations:

| ![clear]                 | ![white]                               | ![outline]                               |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| [cljs.svg]<br>[cljs.png] | [cljs-white.svg]<br>[cljs-white.png]   | [cljs-outline.svg]<br>[cljs-outline.png] |

The _outline_ variation is mainly used at scales where the "cljs" letters
become too small to be legible.
